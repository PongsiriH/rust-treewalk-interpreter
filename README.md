# rust-treewalk-interpreter
Learning Rust and Go, so I have two versions: this one in Rust, another one in Go [crafting interpreter in Go](https://github.com/PongsiriH/crafting-interpreter-go.git).

### How I feel
This is quite nice. This is written after I wrote the one in Go and I finish up until `interpreter` within a day. Everything is going so smoothly.
